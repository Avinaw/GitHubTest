* Delete repo *GitCommand"
* Fork *https://github.com/joshnh/Git-Commands* in your GitLab account with the name *GitCommand*
* Clone *GitCommand* repo using http protocol
* Delete the cloned code
* Clone *GitCommand* repo using git protocol at ~/ninja
* Create a folder *ninja*
* Create a file *README.md* in *ninja* folder
* Make your changes available to *GitCommand* remote repo

### Good To Do
* Get the latest code from remote repo without using *git pull* command
* Create 2 repositories in you Git Lab account *Repo1* & *Repo2* in *Repo1*. Create 2 branches *branchR11 and branchR12* in *Repo1*, similarly create 2 branches *branchR21 and branchR22* in *Repo2*. Now merge code of branch *branchR11* in *Repo1* to *branchR22* in *Repo2*.
