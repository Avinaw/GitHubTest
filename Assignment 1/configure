FTP CONFIGURE

check ufw status
sudo ufw allow 20/tcp	(for data tranfer among vsftpd and client) 
sudo ufw allow 21/tcp	(for connection maintenance of ftp)
sudo ufw allow 990/tls   	( for tls certificate )
sudo ufw allow 40000:50000  (Enabled as psav range is given is used)

Then configure

I have configured my vsftpd.conf manually. I have uploaded a copy of my vsftpd.conf

1. anonymous_enable=NO

enabling it will make any other to log to communicate to our ftp server.
2. local_enable=YES 		(for local user)

3. write_enable=YES
to allow others to write on ftp hosted machine

4.chroot_local_user=YES
user_sub_token=$USER
local_root=/home/$USER/central 

Enabling it will make client to access certain directory. Even if they enter cd / they will go to this directory . Chroot concept.

5. pasv_min_port=40000
    pasv_max_port=50000
Specifying available ports to use as random port while transferring in passive connection

6.
userlist_enable=YES
userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd.userlist
userlist_deny=NO

Conent in vsftpd.userlist
alex
(alex can access)

Here we can specify user whose credentials to use while logging. 

Subsequently we can also use userlist_deny to disable or restrict user present.
7.
Generate ssl certificate using
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem -out /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
Enter contry name 
etc..
8.
paste the located keys in conf file

rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem

9.
Enable ssl_enalable=yes
10.
ssl_tlsv1=YES
